# Weiss Neutral Atom Quantum Computing
In  our experiments, we **_laser cool_** atoms to microKelvin and nanoKelvin temperatures and trap them using light.  Many of our light traps are **_optical lattices_**, which can confine atoms in 3D arrays of sites, in stacks of pancake-like 2D traps, or in bundles of 1D tubes.

Atoms in optical lattices are model quantum mechanical systems. Our three distinct apparatuses applies these model systems to the study of three distinct kinds of physics. Our **_quantum computing apparatus_** aims to use individual atoms as qubits, in order to study novel entangled states and with an eye toward a universal quantum computer. Information about the other experiments can be find
